## About Me 

I am Joseph Gareri, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelors in Computer Science with a Concentration in Cybersecurity as well as a Mathematics minor. 

## Projects

Projects are OpenAI API integrations. Project is built on discord.js and used in a Discord server that I own. Projects were built from examples found on the internet.

## Skills

Proficient in Visual Studio and C++. However, my projects are in JavaScript because I am self-learning in that language. My C++ projects can be found in the Data Structures folder.

## Coursework

As discussed above, this folder contains my various assignments and projects in my college courses.
