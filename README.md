## About Me 

I am Joseph Gareri, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelors in Computer Science with a Concentration in Cybersecurity as well as a Mathematics minor. 

## Projects

Both projects are OpenAI API integrations. One project is built on discord.js and used in a Discord server that I own. The other is using Streamer.bot to communicate with Twitch API. Streamer.bot can be found at 
https://streamer.bot/

## Skills

Proficient in Visual Studio and C++. However, my projects are in JavaScript and C# because I am self-learning in those languages. My C++ projects can be found in the Data Structures folder.

## Coursework

As discussed above, this folder contains my various assignments and projects in my Data Structures course.
